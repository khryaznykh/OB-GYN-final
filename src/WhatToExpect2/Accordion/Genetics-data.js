Sometimes, nature makes mistakes during fertilization, resulting in missing, or extra, parts of the chromosome pair. The test analyzes cfDNA fragments across the whole genome, which has advantages over other NIPT methodologies, including targeted sequencing and array-based tests1. It screens all 23 chromosome pairs, reporting aneuploidies, large deletions and duplications greater than 7 Mb in addition to select microdeletions2. Genome-wide NIPT screens for a range of other chromosome abnormalities that can occur in pregnancy, covering all chromosomes except the X and Y chromosomes3",

A sample of some of the placental tissue that is obtained during CVS contains the same genetic material as the fetus and can be tested for chromosomal abnormalities and some other genetic problems. Testing is available for other genetic defects and disorders, depending on your family history and the availability of lab testing at the time of the procedure. Unlike amniocentesis, CVS does not provide information on open neural tube defects. Therefore, women who undergo CVS also need a follow-up blood test between 16 and 18 weeks of pregnancy to screen for these defects. CVS may be offered to women with an increased risk of chromosomal abnormalities or who have a family history of a genetic defect that is testable from the placental tissue.",
